# Data Science with Python

## Overview
- This repository is designed to provide comprehensive resources and examples for anyone looking to learn or deepen their knowledge of **Python** in the field of **Data Science**.
- It covers everything from data handling to machine learning, focusing on the essential libraries and techniques used by data scientists worldwide.

### Key Concepts Covered:
- **Data Handling**: Loading, cleaning, and preparing data from different sources (CSV, JSON, SQL, APIs).
- **Data Analysis**: Using **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data manipulation and exploration.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating informative visualizations with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.
- **Machine Learning**: Implementing machine learning algorithms using **Scikit-learn** and **TensorFlow**.
- **Model Evaluation**: Techniques for evaluating model performance and making data-driven decisions.

Throughout this repository, you will find Jupyter notebooks, Python scripts, and detailed explanations on the most common data science tasks and techniques.

## Getting Started
These instructions will help you get the project up and running on your local machine for development and experimentation.

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that you have **Python 3.11.2** installed on your machine. You’ll also need to install some essential libraries used in the repository, such as **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Scikit-learn**.

### Installation
To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Data-Science-with-Python.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Data-Science-with-Python
```

It's recommended to create a **virtual environment** to manage the dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate   # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
```

Then, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.


## Usage
Once the repository is set up, you can start exploring the notebooks and scripts. Here's what you'll find in each section:

### 1. **Data Handling**:
Learn how to load, clean, and transform various types of data (CSV, JSON, SQL, etc.) using **Pandas** and **NumPy**.

### 2. **Data Analysis**:
Explore how to manipulate and analyze data using **Pandas** for data frames and **NumPy** for numerical computations.

### 3. **Data Visualization**:
Create powerful visualizations to communicate insights using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.

### 4. **Machine Learning**:
Learn the basics of machine learning by applying algorithms such as regression, classification, and clustering with **Scikit-learn** and **TensorFlow**.

### 5. **Model Evaluation**:
Understand how to evaluate the performance of your machine learning models using techniques like cross-validation, confusion matrices, and hyperparameter tuning.

### Example Notebook

Here’s how you can open and run the Jupyter notebooks in this repository:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This will launch a Jupyter notebook interface in your browser, where you can open any of the provided notebooks (e.g., `Data-Visualization.ipynb`) and follow along with the examples.

### Running Scripts

For Python scripts (e.g., `data_cleaning.py`), simply run them via the command line:

```bash
python data_cleaning.py
```

These scripts contain step-by-step implementations for various data science tasks and are great for automating tasks or running experiments.
